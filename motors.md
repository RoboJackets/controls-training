# DC Motors

This is the website for the DC Motor training conducted in Spring 2021.

## Seminar Info

Date: Sunday, March 28 at 6:30pm

Location: Virtual Google Meet

## Important Links

[Programming Language Form](https://forms.gle/Qcyw3fMNwqtrXuoq5)

## Topic List

- How Brushed DC Motors Work
  - Physical Principles
  - Equivalent Circuit Model
- Brushed Motor Control Circuits
  - H Bridges
  - PWM Control
  - Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)
- Designing with Brushed DC Motors
  - Reading motor curves
  - Simulating motor performance
- Feedback Control
  - Sensors
  - Example Control Loop
  - PID Control

Note: Some of the topics covered overlap with undergraduate
control courses (ECE 3550, 4550). In particular, part of the lecture
will be covering the hardware aspects of these classes that
were lost due to the pandemic. This seminar is a great way to gain
exposure to these topics from a practical approach!

## Prerequisite knowledge

- Calculus (Integrals and Derivatives)
- Basic Differential Equations (what are ODEs, etc)
- Basic Physics (Newton's Laws, Ohm's Law, Kirchoff's Laws)
- Programming (Either MATLAB or Python)

Please contact Varun Madabushi on Slack if you have any questions or topics you may want to add in.
