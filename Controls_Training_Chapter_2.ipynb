    "The goal of a control system designer is to develop a rule (controller) that selects an input to make the output what we want. PID is a commonly used controller because you can often tune a PID loop without any particular understanding of how the underlying system works.  While this may be convenient, in order to overcome the previously mentioned shortcomings of PID, we must first develop a strong theory of dynamic modeling, or mathematically predicting how these systems evolve over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## General Mathematical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic systems are, in the mathematical sense, a series of differential equations which describe how an output signal changes with regards to an input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous chapter, the output of a dynamic system can be described as a function of its *state variables* and its input.  To state this mathematically, \n",

    "## Linear, Time-Invariant Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "We will pay special attention to systems that are called __Linear Time-invariant (LTI)__ as they have special useful properties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The word *Linear* refers to the fact that their output is a linear combination of state and input variables.  \n",
    "Linear systems have two useful properties: (1) that scaling the input results in the output to be scaled by the same amount, and (2) that adding together two inputs is equivalent to adding together two outputs that are evaluated separately.  \n",
    "For an input $u$ which yields an output $y$ when passed through an LTI system, the relationships are mathematically stated below:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The word *Time-invariant* refers to the fact that the relationship between state, input, and output is the same no matter when you start the system.  These useful properties can be exploited to simplify the math. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transfer Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For an LTI system, the output is a linear combination of input and state variables.  If you select state variables according to the common convention (derivatives of the desired system output) then you will reach the following equation\n",
    "$$ a_0 y + a_1 y' + a_2 y'' + a_3 y''' + ... a_n y^{(n)} = b_0 u + b_1 u' + b_2 u'' + b_3 u''' + ... b_m u^{(m)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the order of the system $n > m$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to take the Laplace transform of both sides, resulting in two polynomials in $s$.  This can be rearranged to form a new equation,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \\frac{b_0 + b_1 s + b_2 s^2 + b_3 s^3 ... + b_m s^m}{a_0 + a_1 s + a_2 s^2 + a_3 s^3 ... + a_n s^n} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how we have turned a complex differential equation into a rational function through the use of the Laplace Transform.  This rational function represents the relationship between the Laplace Transform of the input $U(s)$ and output $Y(s)$.  This is called the __Transfer Function.__  We care a lot about the denominator of the transfer function, which we refer to as the _characteristic equation._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transfer Function is the core of classical control techniques (developed in the 1920s and popularized in industry in the 1950s).  It is indeed useful as it allows the complex time-domain behaviors to be perfectly captured in a simple rational function.  Unfortunately it becomes limited and a bit difficult to deal with as the order gets large. Advances in mathematics have brought about a new theory which simplifies the manipulation of differential equations by introducing linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Space form\n",
    "\n",
    "In LTI systems, the state derivative and output are both possible to represent as linear combinations of the current state variables and the input.  In your differential equations course, you have likely studied how to convert a high-order linear differential equation (such as a system dynamics equation in input-output form) into a matrix of differential equations.  We can also write such a matrix directly from a set of dynamics equations without even converting them to input-output form.  This process is shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "For some system with a rotary position $\\theta$ and input $u$, suppose the dynamic equations can be stated as \n",

We can select the two state variables to be $\\theta$ and $\\dot{\\theta}$, then add another equation representing as such.  From this, we can concatenate the two state variables to create a unified state vector,\n",
